# Project 5 - Humans of New York Feed

Submitted by: **Gerald Shimo**

**Humans of New York Feed** is an iOS app that fetches and displays a scrolling list of blog posts from the **Humans of New York** Tumblr API. Each post shows a photo and a short summary of the story, allowing users to explore real human stories directly within a clean, minimalist table view.

## ðŸ§© Notes

### Challenges Encountered:
- Debugging why the table view showed a blank screen despite successful API calls â€” caused by missing storyboard connections (`dataSource` and `delegate`).  
- Ensuring that Tumblrâ€™s optional `photos` array decoded correctly by making it optional in the data model.  
- Handling dynamic content sizing for varying post summaries using Auto Layout and `UITableView.automaticDimension`.
